    <h1>Alejandra Vogel</h1>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>At my core, I’m a mum who’s raised three amazing boys across three continents — 
        a journey that’s taught me resilience, adaptability, creativ thinking, leadership, and the art of staying calm in chaos. 
        That same knowledge and experience fuels my passion for marketing and design. 
        <br>
        With more experience than i really desire,
        I bring warmth, clarity, and creative strategy to every project, always aiming to connect, inspire, and lead with heart.</p>
